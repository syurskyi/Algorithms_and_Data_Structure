# Introduction to Array Based Sequences

In this lecture, we will get a brief overview of the "sequence" type object classes available in Python.
These are mainly the **list**,**tuple**, and **string** objects. The main commonaility between these object types is
the ability to index to access individual elements in the sequence. For example:
'''

# %%
l _ [1,2,3]
l[0]

# %%
t _ (1,2,3)
t[0]

# %%
s _ '123'
s[0]

# %%
'''
## Please refer to the video lecture for the remaining information.
## The section consists mostly of video explanations not well-suited for Jupyter Notebooks.
# Thanks!
