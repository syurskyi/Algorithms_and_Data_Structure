# Stacks Overview
# Please see the lecture video for the full Overview on Stacks!
# A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always
# takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the top. The end opposite the top is known
# as the base.
#
# The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those
# that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed
# first.
# This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out. It provides an ordering based on length
# of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.
#
# For example, consider the figure below:

# Note how the first items "pushed" to the stack begin at the base, and as items are "popped" out.
# Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is
# the reverse of the order of removal.
# Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of stacks that occur as you use your computer.
# For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate from web page to web page, those pages are placed
# on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are going on the stack). The current page that you are viewing is on
# the top and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin
# to move in reverse order through the pages.
