# Memoization
#
# In this lecture we will discuss memoization and dynamic programming. For your homework assignment, read
# the Wikipedia article on Memoization, before continuing on with this lecture!
# Memoization effectively refers to remembering ("memoization" -> "memorandum" -> to be remembered) results of method
# calls based on the method inputs and then returning the remembered result rather than computing the result again.
# You can think of it as a cache for method results. We'll use this in some of the interview problems as improved
# versions of a purely recursive solution.
#
# A simple example for computing factorials using memoization in Python would be something like this:
#
# # Create cache for known results
factorial_memo = {}

def factorial(k):

    if k < 2:
        return 1

    if not k in factorial_memo:
        factorial_memo[k] = k * factorial(k-1)

    return factorial_memo[k]

factorial(4)
# 24
#
# Note how we are now using a dictionary to store previous results of the factorial function! We are now able
# to increase the efficiency of this function by remembering old results!
# Keep this in mind when working on the Coin Change Problem and the Fibonacci Sequence Problem.
# We can also encapsulate the memoization process into a class:

class Memoize:
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f = f
        self.memo = {}
    def __call__(self, *args):
        if not args in self.memo:
            self.memo[args] = self.f(*args)
        return self.memo[args]

# Then all we would have to do is:

def factorial(k):

    if k < 2:
        return 1

    return k * factorial(k - 1)

factorial = Memoize(factorial)

# Try comparing the run times of the memoization versions of functions versus the normal recursive solutions!
