# Largest Continuous Sum
# Problem
# Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum.
# Solution
# If the array is all positive, then the result is simply the sum of all numbers. The negative numbers in the array will
# cause us to need to begin checking sequences.
# The algorithm is, we start summing up the numbers and store in a current sum variable. After adding each element,
# we check whether the current sum is larger than maximum sum encountered so far. If it is, we update the maximum sum.
# As long as the current sum is positive, we keep adding the numbers. When the current sum becomes negative, we start
# with a new current sum. Because a negative current sum will only decrease the sum of a future sequence.
# Note that we donâ€™t reset the current sum to 0 because the array can contain all negative integers.
# Then the result would be the largest negative number.
# Let's see the code:

def large_cont_sum(arr):
    # Check to see if array is length 0
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return 0

    # Start the max and current sum at the first element
    max_sum = current_sum = arr[0]

    # For every element in array
    for num in arr[1:]:
        # Set current sum as the higher of the two
        current_sum = max(current_sum + num, num)

        # Set max as the higher between the currentSum and the current max
        max_sum = max(current_sum, max_sum)

    return max_sum

print(large_cont_sum([1,2,-1,3,4,10,10,-10,-1]))

# Many times in an interview setting the question also requires you to report back the start and end points of the sum.
# Keep this in mind and see if you can solve that problem, we'll see it in the mock interview section of the course!
