# Array Pair Sum
# Problem
#
# Given an integer array, output all the * *unique ** pairs that sum up to a specific value k.
#
# So the input:
#
# pair_sum([1,3,2,2],4)
#
# would return 2 pairs:
#
#  (1,3)
#  (2,2)
#
# NOTE: FOR TESTING PURPOSES< CHANGE YOUR FUNCTION SO IT OUTPUTS THE NUMBER OF PAIRS
# Solution
#
# The O(N) algorithm uses the set data structure. We perform a linear pass from the beginning and for each element we
# check whether k-element is in the set of seen numbers. If it is, then we found a pair of sum k and add it to the
# output. If not, this element doesnâ€™t belong to a pair yet, and we add it to the set of seen elements.
# The algorithm is really simple once we figure out using a set. The complexity is O(N) because we do a single linear
# scan of the array, and for each element we just check whether the corresponding number to form a pair is in the set
# or add the current element to the set. Insert and find operations of a set are both average O(1), so the algorithm
# is O(N) in total.

def pair_sum(arr, k):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return

    # Sets for tracking
    seen = set()
    output = set()

    # For every number in array
    for num in arr:

        # Set target difference
        target = k - num

        # Add it to set if target hasn't been seen
        if target not in seen:
            seen.add(num)

        else:
            # Add a tuple with the corresponding pair
            output.add((min(num, target), max(num, target)))

    # FOR TESTING
    return len(output)
    # Nice one-liner for printing output
    # return '\n'.join(map(str,list(output)))
