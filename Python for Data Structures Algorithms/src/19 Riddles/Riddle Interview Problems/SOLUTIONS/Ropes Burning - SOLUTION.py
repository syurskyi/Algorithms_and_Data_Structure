# Ropes Burning - SOLUTION
# Problem Statement
# You have two ropes. Each takes exactly 60 minutes to burn.
# They are made of different material so even though they take the same amount of time to burn, they burn at separate
# rates. In addition, each rope burns inconsistently.
# How do you measure out exactly 45 minutes?
# Solution
# Take one rope and burn it at both ends.
# At the same time, burn one end of the other rope.
# When the first rope finishes burning, light the other end of the remaining rope.
# When it burns out, that's 45 minutes.
