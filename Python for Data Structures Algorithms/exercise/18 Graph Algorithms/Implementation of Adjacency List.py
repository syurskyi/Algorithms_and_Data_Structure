# Implementation of a Graph as an Adjacency List
# Using dictionaries, it is easy to implement the adjacency list in Python. In our implementation of the Graph abstract
# data type we will create two classes: Graph, which holds the master list of vertices, and Vertex,
# which will represent each vertex in the graph.
# Each Vertex uses a dictionary to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge.
# This dictionary is called connectedTo. The constructor simply initializes the id, which will typically be a string,
# and the connectedTo dictionary. The addNeighbor method is used add a connection from this vertex to another.
# The getConnections method returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the connectedTo
# instance variable. The getWeight method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as
# a parameter.

class Vertex:
    def __init__(self,key):
        self.id = key
        self.connectedTo = {}

    def addNeighbor(self,nbr,weight=0):
        self.connectedTo[nbr] = weight

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.id) + ' connectedTo: ' + str([x.id for x in self.connectedTo])

    def getConnections(self):
        return self.connectedTo.keys()

    def getId(self):
        return self.id

    def getWeight(self,nbr):
        return self.connectedTo[nbr]

# In order to implement a Graph as an Adjacency List what we need to do is define the methods our
# Adjacency List object will have:
#
#     Graph() creates a new, empty graph.
#     addVertex(vert) adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
#     addEdge(fromVert, toVert) Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
#     addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
#     getVertex(vertKey) finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
#     getVertices() returns the list of all vertices in the graph.
#     in returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise.

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertList = {}
        self.numVertices = 0

    def addVertex(self,key):
        self.numVertices = self.numVertices + 1
        newVertex = Vertex(key)
        self.vertList[key] = newVertex
        return newVertex

    def getVertex(self,n):
        if n in self.vertList:
            return self.vertList[n]
        else:
            return None

    def __contains__(self,n):
        return n in self.vertList

    def addEdge(self,f,t,cost=0):
        if f not in self.vertList:
            nv = self.addVertex(f)
        if t not in self.vertList:
            nv = self.addVertex(t)
        self.vertList[f].addNeighbor(self.vertList[t], cost)

    def getVertices(self):
        return self.vertList.keys()

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.vertList.values())

# Let's see a simple example of how to use this:

g = Graph()
for i in range(6):
    g.addVertex(i)

g.vertList

# {0: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x10476b680>,
#  1: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x104cce5f0>,
#  2: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x10395d950>,
#  3: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x1039c00e0>,
#  4: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x1039c4e60>,
#  5: <__main__.Vertex instance at 0x1039c45f0>}
#
g.addEdge(0,1,2)
#
for vertex in g:
    print vertex
    print vertex.getConnections()
    print '\n'

# 0 connectedTo: [1]
# [<__main__.Vertex instance at 0x104cce5f0>]
# 1 connectedTo: []
