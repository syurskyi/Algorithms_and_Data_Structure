# Implementation of Selection Sort
#
# The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by making only one exchange for every pass through the list.
# In order to do this, a selection sort looks for the largest value as it makes a pass and, after completing the pass,
# places it in the proper location. As with a bubble sort, after the first pass, the largest item is in the correct
# place. After the second pass, the next largest is in place. This process continues and requires n−1 passes
# to sort n items, since the final item must be in place after the (n−1) st pass.
