# Implementation of Shell Sort
#
# The shell sort improves on the insertion sort by breaking the original list into a number of smaller sublists,
# each of which is sorted using an insertion sort. The unique way that these sublists are chosen is the key to
# the shell sort. Instead of breaking the list into sublists of contiguous items, the shell sort uses an increment i,
# sometimes called the gap, to create a sublist by choosing all items that are i items apart.

def shell_sort(arr):
    sublistcount = len(arr)/2

    # While we still have sub lists
    while sublistcount > 0:
        for start in range(sublistcount):
            # Use a gap insertion
            gap_insertion_sort(arr,start,sublistcount)



        sublistcount = sublistcount / 2

def gap_insertion_sort(arr,start,gap):
    for i in range(start+gap,len(arr),gap):

        currentvalue = arr[i]
        position = i

        # Using the Gap
        while position>=gap and arr[position-gap]>currentvalue:
            arr[position]=arr[position-gap]
            position = position-gap

        # Set current value
        arr[position]=currentvalue

arr = [45,67,23,45,21,24,7,2,6,4,90]
shell_sort(arr)
arr

# [2, 4, 6, 7, 21, 23, 24, 45, 45, 67, 90]
