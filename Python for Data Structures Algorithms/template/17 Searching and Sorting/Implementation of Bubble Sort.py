# Implementation of a Bubble Sort
#
# The bubble sort makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of
# order. Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place. In essence, each item bubbles
# up to the location where it belongs.

def bubble_sort(arr):
    # For every element (arranged backwards)
    for n in range(len(arr)-1,0,-1):
        #
        for k in range(n):
            # If we come to a point to switch
            if arr[k]>arr[k+1]:
                temp = arr[k]
                arr[k] = arr[k+1]
                arr[k+1] = temp

arr = [3,2,13,4,6,5,7,8,1,20]
bubble_sort(arr)

arr
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 20]
