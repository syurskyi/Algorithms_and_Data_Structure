# Singly Linked List Implementation
# In this lecture we will implement a basic Singly Linked List.
# Remember, in a singly linked list, we have an ordered list of items as individual Nodes that have pointers to
# other Nodes.
#
class Node(object):

    def __init__(self,value):

        self.value = value
        self.nextnode = None
#
# Now we can build out Linked List with the collection of nodes:

a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)
c = Node(3)

a.nextnode = b

b.nextnode = c

# In a Linked List the first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. Let's discuss the pros and
# cons of Linked Lists:
# Pros
#     Linked Lists have constant-time insertions and deletions in any position, in comparison, arrays require O(n)
#     time to do the same thing.
#
#     Linked lists can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time (remember our lectures on
#     Array sizing form the Array Sequence section of the course!)
#
# Cons
#
#     To access an element in a linked list, you need to take O(k) time to go from the head of the list to
#     the kth element. In contrast, arrays have constant time operations to access elements in an array.
#
# Good Job!
#
# That's it for the implementation (pretty simple right?). Up next we will learn about Doubly Linked Lists!
