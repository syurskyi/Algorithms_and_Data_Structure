# Implement a Singly Linked List

# For this interview problem, create a node class and show how it can be used to create a Singly Linked List
#
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.val = value
        self.next = None
    pass
#
# # Create a Singly Linked List here
#
# Test Your Solution
# 
# Note that there is no test for this solution (because it would give away the answer structure).
