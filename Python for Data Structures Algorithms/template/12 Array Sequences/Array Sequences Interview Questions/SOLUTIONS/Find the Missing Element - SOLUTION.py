# Find the Missing Element
# Problem
#
# Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and
# deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
# Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.
# Input:
#
# finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])
#
# Output:
#
# 5 is the missing number
#
# Solution
#
# The naive solution is go through every element in the second array and check whether it appears in the first array.
# Note that there may be duplicate elements in the arrays so we should pay special attention to it. The complexity
# of this approach is O(N^2), since we would need two for loops.
# A more efficient solution is to sort the first array, so while checking whether an element in the first array appears
# in the second, we can do binary search (we'll learn about binary search in more detail in a future section).
# But we should still be careful about duplicate elements. The complexity is O(NlogN).
# If we don’t want to deal with the special case of duplicate numbers, we can sort both arrays and iterate over them
# simultaneously. Once two iterators have different values we can stop. The value of the first iterator is the missing
# element. This solution is also O(NlogN). Here is the solution for this approach:

def finder(arr1, arr2):
    # Sort the arrays
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()

    # Compare elements in the sorted arrays
    for num1, num2 in zip(arr1, arr2):
        if num1 != num2:
            return num1

    # Otherwise return last element
    return arr1[-1]

arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
arr2 = [3,7,2,1,4,6]
print(finder(arr1,arr2))

# 5

# In most interviews, you would be expected to come up with a linear time solution. We can use a hashtable and store
# the number of times each element appears in the second array. Then for each element in the first array we decrement
# its counter. Once hit an element with zero count that’s the missing element. Here is this solution:

import collections

def finder2(arr1, arr2):
    # Using default dict to avoid key errors
    d = collections.defaultdict(int)

    # Add a count for every instance in Array 1
    for num in arr2:
        d[num] += 1

        # Check if num not in dictionary
    for num in arr1:
        if d[num] == 0:
            return num

            # Otherwise, subtract a count
        else:
            d[num] -= 1

arr1 = [5,5,7,7]
arr2 = [5,7,7]

finder2(arr1,arr2)

# One possible solution is computing the sum of all the numbers in arr1 and arr2, and subtracting arr2’s sum from
# array1’s sum. The difference is the missing number in arr2. However, this approach could be problematic if the arrays
# are too long, or the numbers are very large. Then overflow will occur while summing up the numbers.
#
# By performing a very clever trick, we can achieve linear time and constant space complexity without any problems.
# Here it is: initialize a variable to 0, then XOR every element in the first and second arrays with that variable.
# In the end, the value of the variable is the result, missing element in array2.

def finder3(arr1, arr2):
    result = 0

    # Perform an XOR between the numbers in the arrays
    for num in arr1 + arr2:
        result ^= num
        print(result)

    return result

finder3(arr1,arr2)
