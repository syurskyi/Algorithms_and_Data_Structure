# Find the Missing Element
## Problem
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and
deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.
Input:
    finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])
Output:
    5 is the missing number
## Solution
Fill out your solution below:
'''

# %%
def finder(arr1,arr2):
    num = 0
    for n in arr1:
        num += n
    for n in arr2:
        num -= n
    return num
    pass

# %%
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
arr2 = [3,7,2,1,4,6]
finder(arr1,arr2)

# %%
arr1 = [5,5,7,7]
arr2 = [5,7,7]

finder(arr1,arr2)
