This solution will first parse the alphametic expression
grouping and counting letters buy digit ranks
then trace recursively all possible permutations starting from
the lowest rank and genrating additional permutations for new digits
at higer ranks as necessary.
This will allow to avoid unnesessarily large permutations to scan.
Also leading letters in words will be treated as non-zero digits only
to reduce the number of permutations
