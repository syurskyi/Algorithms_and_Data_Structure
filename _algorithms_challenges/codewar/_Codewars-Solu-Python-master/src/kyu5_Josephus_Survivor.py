    In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor",
    ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.

    Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and
    that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

    josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle;
    one every 3 is eliminated until one remains
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
    [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
    [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
    [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
    [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
    [1,4] => 5 is counted out
    [4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!
    The above link about the "base" kata description will give you a more thorough insight about
    the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all that there is to know to solve this kata.

    Notes and tips: using the solution to the other kata to check your function may be helpful,
    but as much larger numbers will be used, using an array/list to compute the number of the survivor may be too slow;
    you may assume that both n and k will always be >=1.
